# Extending the service with APIs
{: #iot4i_extending_service}
{{site.data.keyword.iotinsurance_full}} provides APIs to customize and extend your {{site.data.keyword.iotinsurance_short}} solution.
{:shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.iotinsurance_short}} comes with built-in support for Wink water leak sensors. By using the provided APIs, you can customize the {{site.data.keyword.iotinsurance_short}} solution to support new device types and vendors. {{site.data.keyword.iotinsurance_short}} relies on cloud-to-cloud communication to get sensor data from devices. By creating new transformation micro-services, you can customize {{site.data.keyword.iotinsurance_short}} to read the sensor data from new devices, pass it to the rest of the system through the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} service, and then take actions as appropriate.

For a full set of example code, see the [API examples GitHub repository](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/iot4i-api-examples-nodejs/#iot-for-insurance-api-examples).

For complete information about the APIs, see the [API documentation](https://iot4i-api-docs.mybluemix.net/).
