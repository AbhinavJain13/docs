The {{site.data.keyword.iotinsurance_full}} sample mobile app is a reference implementation for a mobile client of {{site.data.keyword.iotinsurance_short}}. You can use the app to register new devices in the system and receive alerts for the devices.
{:shortdesc}

**Prerequisites:** Before you begin, ensure that the following prerequisites are in place:
  - Apple Xcode 7.3 or higher integrated development environment.
  - An iOS 9.0 or higher iPhone mobile device.
  - CocoaPods installed on your computer. See the [CocoaPods website](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).
  - The [parameters](#iot4i_mobileParam) that are required to connect the sample mobile app to your instance of the service.

## Building the sample mobile app
{: #building_mobile}
To try the sample mobile app, perform the following tasks:

1. Clone the [source code repository for the sample mobile app](https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/ioti-mobile) onto a computer on which Xcode 7.3 or above is installed.
2. Install the required packages and generate the IoT4I.xcworkspace file by running a CocoaPods pod install command on your project. CocoaPods must be installed to complete this task.
3. Open the project in Xcode by double-clicking the IoT4I.xcworkspace file.
4. Connect your iPhone to your computer and select it as a build destination.
5. Select the IoT4I file in the list of files to display the Identity dialog box.
6. In the Identity dialog box in Xcode, make the following changes:
  - Change the **Bundle Identifier** to a unique identifier, for example: **myIoT4Ibundle**.
  - Set **Team** to your personal team name and then click **Fix Issue**.
7. To connect your app to your instance of {{site.data.keyword.iotinsurance_short}}, set the following parameters in the **constants.swift** file:  
    - [applicationRoute](#iot4i_mobileParam) = the URL for your instance of {{site.data.keyword.iotinsurance_short}}
    - [applicationId](#iot4i_mobileParam) = the URL for your instance of {{site.data.keyword.amashort}}
8. On your computer, click the arrow to build and run the current scheme. The sample mobile app is installed on your phone. For more information, see the [Apple developer instructions for running apps on devices from Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/LaunchingYourApponDevices/LaunchingYourApponDevices.html).

  **Note:** If an error is displayed when you try to build that says *Could not launch IoT4I because you have not yet verified that your Developer App certificate is trusted on your device*, select yourself as a Trusted Developer, as follows:  
    1. On your phone, go to **Settings > General > Device Management > yourDeveloperID**.
    2. Tap your developer ID account name to establish trust for your developer ID.
    3. When prompted, confirm that the developer ID is trusted.
