# Developer Insights (Experimental)
{: #gettingstarted}

{{site.data.keyword.DRA_full}} Developer Insights provides a comprehensive way to explore your projectâ€™s development risk. You can identify files with high error proneness and get a compliance view of the project against DevOps practices.
{:shortdesc}

After you open {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} from your toolchain, click **Developer Insights**. From there, you can select an analytic category to dive deeper into your project's codebase. What each set of data indicates can vary from team to team, and you can drill down into each visualization for help and guidance. 

**Note:** Developer Insights is available to only IBM employees and a limited number of external parties. 

## Data categories

The data that {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} uses to populate its dashboards is mined automatically from your team's source-control repository. By default, this data is not restricted to any particular period or set of labels, but you can configure the data from the **Settings** menu. 

On any chart, click the **Information** or **Guidance** buttons for more information about what the data means and how you can apply it to your project. 

### Error Proneness

*Error proneness* is the likelihood that a file or commit might generate defects according to historical trends, committer experience, change frequency, change weight, and other factors. 

You might look to this category while you conduct code reviews or improve the code review process. Risky files deserve more scrutiny than relatively safe ones. Conversely, safe files and commits can serve as examples for your team as you improve how you work.

### Issues

The Issues category displays all of your team's work-tracking issues in one place. The issues are automatically grouped by type, priority, and tag, and can be shown over time. 

These issue groupings can vary in meaning from team to team. One team might want to know whether most items that are tagged for a particular release are closed, while another team might not tag releases and instead work according to open-issue priority.  

### Commits

Commits indicate the work that your team members are contributing to your codebase. Examine your commit data to understand where effort is being expended historically and how you can better balance your team members' workloads. 

### Files

The Files category shows which of your project's files are the busiest. Whether by number of line changes, commits, authors, or defects, this data indicates where your team is most active. 

Generally, try to reduce both the number of hands that touch a file and that file's change frequency. This goal might be impossible with certain files, such as common configuration files. However, many developers making many changes to the same file at the same time is a recipe for trouble. 

<!--## WORKING - Garage Method tie in?

Add paragraph linking to GM. Not sure what form this would take--are there identified practices here? The Bluemix Docs material should generally not be prescriptive, especially given that the product UI doesn't often indicate what to do with data, but there's an opportunity to link out for interested parties. -->
