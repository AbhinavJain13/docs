The monitor exposes four distinct screens:
* A "Resouces" screen containing data about Certificate Authority, peers and ordering nodes.
* A "Channels" screen for creating new channels and viewing ledger, chaincode and membership info for existing channels.
* A "Chaincode" screen for easy installation and instantiation of chaincodes across your network.
* A "Support" screen with links and suggestions for obtaining help and debugging problems.
