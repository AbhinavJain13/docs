Both plans, the Starter Developer and High Security Business Network, unlock several features in the Hyperledger fabric which robustly enhance availability, security, confidentiality and privacy; and the configuration is such that you are able to test and affirm these features.  Each instance runs as a four-node network with a Certificate Authority managing identities and member permissions, and each network leverages the same capabilites from the core fabric. The only fundamental difference between the two is their operating/hosting environment.  The developer network runs in a shared multi-tenant environment on Softlayer, whereas the high security network exists as an isolated single-tenant running in a secure services container.

<!---The High-Security business network provides important capabilities above and beyond the two-node multi-tenant developer service on Softlayer (aimed towards application development; writing chaincode and experimenting with APIs).  The high security plan supplies your own private blockchain test environment, which has been vetted and secured by IBM.  With the following features, your dedicated and high security environment enables you to take the next step towards preparing your organization for enterprise blockchain networks:~~

~~1. A dedicated four-node blockchain network; single-tenant with no shared resources~~
~~2. An IBM-certified version of the latest Hyperledger fabric, along with mechanisms to unlock inherent identity and security features~~
~~3. Isolation and protection from system and platform administrators, root users, and unauthorized users.~~
~~4. Verified test cases for security, consensus, availability, and performance--->
