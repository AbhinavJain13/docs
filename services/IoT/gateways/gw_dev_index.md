# Developing gateways on {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}
{: #gw_dev_index}

If your devices cannot directly connect to the internet, you can build a gateway device to retrieve and send data to applications in your {{site.data.keyword.iot_full}} organization. Client libraries, samples, and information are provided to help you to connect device gateways to your {{site.data.keyword.iot_full}} organization and applications.
