MQTT version | Notes
--- | --- | ---
[3.1.1](https://www.oasis-open.org/standards#mqttv3.1.1) (recommended)  | <ul><li>OASIS Standard.<li>ISO standard (ISO/IEC PRF 20922) <li>Improved interoperability between various clients and servers because of a more precise definition of the protocol compared to V3.1.   <li>The maximum length of the MQTT client identifier (ClientId) is increased to 256 from the 23 character limit that is imposed by V3.1. </br>The {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} service often requires longer client IDs. </br>Long client IDs are supported regardless of the MQTT protocol version. However, some V3.1 client libraries check the length of the ClientId value and enforce the 23 character limit.</ul>
3.1 | MQTT V3.1 is the version of the protocol that is in widest use today.

{{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} supports any content that is permitted by the MQTT standard. MQTT is data-agnostic, so it's possible to send images, texts that are in any encoding, encrypted data, and virtually every type of data in binary format. For more information about the MQTT standard, see the following resources:
