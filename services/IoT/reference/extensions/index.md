External service integration allows you to bind metadata or function supported by another service to your {{site.data.keyword.iot_full}} organization.

## Jasper
{: #jasper}

Jasper is an administration and management platform for SIM devices. Jasper is integrated into the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} dashboard, making it possible to administer Jasper devices through your {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} organization dashboard.

**Important:** Jasper integration is currently available as part of a limited beta.  Future updates might include changes incompatible with the current version of this feature.

### Supported operations

The built-in Jasper integration that is provided by our platform provides support for the following Jasper operations:

- View overall Jasper data
  - Shows: Status, Rate Plan, month-to-date data usage, month-to-date SMS usage, month-to-date voice usage, overage limits, date added, and date modified.
- Change SIM activation state.
  - Select from: Inventory, Activation Ready, Activated, Deactivated, and Retired.
- View SIM Usage
  - Shows: Cycle start date, billable and total data, billable and total SMS, billable and total voice.
  - The cycle start date can be set using a YYYY-MM-DD format.
- Send SMS to SIM
- Change rate plan

You can access the supported operations in the device drilldown of a Jasper connected device after the following configuration steps are completed.

You can configure the devices that are connected to both your {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} organization and your Jasper account to display data from Jasper in the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} dashboard.  
**Important:** The Jasper configuration cannot be applied as part of the Add Device process, as only already connected devices can be configured with Jasper.  
To configure your Jasper-connected devices, complete the following steps:  
 1. In the devices tab of your {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} dashboard, find the Jasper-connected device to be configured.
 2. Select the device to open the *Device Drilldown* view.
 3. Scroll down to *Extension Configuration*.
 4. Enter the extension configuration by using the following JSON format, and then click **Confirm changes** to save your configuration.

## Blockchain
{: #blockchain}

{{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} with blockchain enables IoT devices to provide data to blockchain transactions, which stores the data in the blockchain's immutable ledger and uses it in smart contract business rules. {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} maps device data to the data format that is required by the blockchain's smart contract and passes it to a blockchain fabric to store in the blockchain ledger.

### Supported operations
- Trigger smart contract updates with device events.
- Run smart contract business logic to update ledger state with device event data.
- Monitor the blockchain, transactions, and ledger state with the monitoring UI.
