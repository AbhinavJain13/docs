# APIs
{: #overview}

{{site.data.keyword.iot_full}} provides a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) which are implemented based on Representational State Transfer (REST) services. The APIs enable applications to use the same interface to interact with {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}, regardless of the language in which the application is written. An HTTP status code is used to indicate the success or failure of the operation.

Use the following links to find out more about the REST APIs that are provided by {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}:
