# About toolchains    
{: #toolchains_about}  

Toolchains are available in the Public and Dedicated environments on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}. You can create a toolchain in two ways: use a template to create a toolchain or create a toolchain from an app. As a starting point, you can use a toolchain template. Depending on the template that you use, you can create a toolchain that has a specific set of tool integrations or an empty toolchain that you can add tool integrations to.

On {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public, depending on the template or toolchain that you use, the toolchain might include a GitHub repository (repo) that is populated with app starter code and a preconfigured delivery pipeline. When you push changes to the toolchain's GitHub repo, the delivery pipeline automatically builds and deploys the app to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. 

On {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated, depending on the toolchain that you use, the toolchain might include a GitHub Enterprise repo that is populated with app starter code and a preconfigured delivery pipeline. When you push changes to the toolchain's GitHub Enterprise repo, the delivery pipeline automatically builds and deploys the apps to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.

## Getting help and support for toolchains 
{: #gettinghelp}

If you have problems or questions when you use toolchains, you can get help by searching for information or by asking questions in a forum. You can also [open a support ticket (Link opens in a new window)](https://www.{DomainName}/docs/support/index.html#open-ticket). 

The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} development and support teams actively monitor Stack Overflow and dW Answers, and follow the questions that are tagged with ibm-bluemix, continuous-delivery, and bluemix-continuous-delivery. When you create a question in either forum, tag your question so that the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} development and support teams see it.

* If you have technical questions about developing or deploying an app with toolchains, post your question on [Stack Overflow (Link opens in new window)](http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=ibm-bluemix+continuous-delivery){:new_window} and tag your question with "ibm-bluemix" and "continuous-delivery".
