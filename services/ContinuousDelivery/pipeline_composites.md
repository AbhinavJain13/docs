# Creating composite pipelines (Experimental)
{: #deliverypipeline_create_composite}

With the composite pipeline feature for {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}}, you can manage repeatable continuous integration and continuous delivery processes for related software applications.
{:shortdesc}

## Creating a composite pipeline
{: #compositepipeline_create_for_toolchain}

1. From the menu near the Bluemix logo, click **Services > DevOps**

1. From the left navigation, click **Pipelines**.

2. Enable the composite pipeline feature by clicking **Learn more** and then clicking **Enable**. The composite pipeline is enabled for each user, so only the members of your organization who opt in to the experimental feature see the composite pipelines that you create.

2. Click **Create** > **Composite Pipeline**.

3. Type a name for the composite pipeline. You can also modify the pipeline description.

4. From the **Toolchain** list, select a toolchain.

    1. To create an empty toolchain and composite pipeline, select **New**.

    2. To create a composite pipeline for one of your toolchains, select its name.

5. If you create an empty toolchain, select **Add default environments**. You use these default logical environments to control process execution through the composite pipeline.

6. Click **Create**.

The stages that you configured are automatically mapped to the appropriate space in your organization and a deployment plan is created for the composite pipeline.

If you created the composite pipeline for a toolchain that contains delivery pipelines, apps for all of the pipelines in the toolchain are added to the composite pipeline. The stages that you configured in the delivery pipelines are automatically mapped to the appropriate spaces in your organization, and their status is displayed.
To view the status of each job in an app, expand the app.

A deployment plan is also created for the composite pipeline. By default, the jobs for all apps run in parallel for a space, but you can change the deployment order in the plan.

If you created the composite pipeline for a new toolchain, a deployment plan is created for you to customize.

## Modifying the deployment plan
{: #compositepipeline_modify_dp}

By default, a deployment plan is created for a composite pipeline. This deployment plan captures all of the information about the stages in any Delivery Pipelines in the toolchain. You can view and modify the deployment plan for each stage.

In the stage that you want to modify the deployment plan for, click the menu and click **Deployment plan**.

![Open the deployment plan](images/open_deployment_plan.png "open the deployment plan")

The list of deployment tasks for your environment is displayed.

## Using IBM Bluemix DevOps Connect to integrate with IBM UrbanCode Deploy
{: #compositepipeline_devops_connect}

IBM Bluemix DevOps Connect coordinates communication between your on-premises IBM&reg; UrbanCode&reg; Deploy  installation and {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}}. After you install DevOps Connect, you can create integrations that enable you to manage UrbanCode Deploy applications with composite pipelines.

**Prerequisites**

* To register DevOps Connect, you must have an IBMid.

* You must have [Javaâ„¢ Runtime Environment version 8 update 121 or later](https://java.com/en/download/){:new_window} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon") on the host system and set the system PATH variable to its location.

* You need an admin authorization token from UrbanCode Deploy.


1. Install DevOps Connect and use it to integrate your org with UrbanCode Deploy.

  1.  From within a composite pipeline, click **Add app** and from the **Managed by** list, select **IBM UrbanCode Deploy**.

  1. Display the integration steps.

  1.  In the Configure UrbanCode Deploy Integration dialog box, click **Download** to download DevOps Connect. Place the JAR file on a computer that has access to UrbanCode Deploy.

  1.  Using the dialog box, copy the DevOps Connect installation script. The script contains the command to start DevOps Connect and the credentials that are required to identify your {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} Bluemix service.

  1.  On the computer where you placed DevOps Connect, open a command shell and paste the copied script into it.

  1.  Run the script.  DevOps Connect displays startup messages.

2. Register DevOps Connect.

  1.  On the computer where you placed DevOps Connect, use a web browser to open the DevOps Connect dashboard. The default URL is `https://localhost:8443`. To change the URL and learn about other startup options, see the [DevOps Connect documentation](https://developer.ibm.com/urbancode/plugindoc/urbancode-sync/ibm-urbancode-sync-utility/1-2/){:new_window} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")

  <!-- 1.  On the registration page, specify a name for the DevOps Connect installation.

  1.  Click **Register**. The first time that you access DevOps Connect, you are prompted to register it with your IBMid. -->

  1.  On the **Sign-in to IBM** page, enter your IBMid and password, and then click **Sign In**. You sign in each time you start DevOps Connect.

3. With DevOps Connect, use the IBM UrbanCode Deploy for DevOps Connect plug-in to create an integration between your org and UrbanCode Deploy.

    1.  From the Integrations page, click **Add New**.

    1.  In the **Name** field, enter a name for the integration.

    1.  From the **Integration Type** list, select **IBM UrbanCode Deploy for DevOps Connect**.
