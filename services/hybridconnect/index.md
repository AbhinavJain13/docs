{{site.data.keyword.HybridConnect_full}} allows you to connect your on-premise IBM software products to your {{site.data.keyword.HybridConnect_short}} service instance and gain insight into your running inventory and runtime usage metrics.
{:shortdesc}

Your {{site.data.keyword.HybridConnect_short}} service instance (that you will create in the next step) is associated to a single Organization and Space and will have unique credentials.  You will have to have at least one Organization/space setup.  If you need to separate the data (for example, limiting access to specific individuals), then you can create multiple spaces within an organization, and have a service instance in each space.  Each service instance will unique credentials that you will need to provide to your IBM software products. 

You will only be able to see the information for the products configured with each set of credentials within the service instance with those credentials.  For the Experimental service, it is recommended that you use a single service instance for simplicity.

You can find available services in the Catalog under Services in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} user interface.  Experimental services (like {{site.data.keyword.HybridConnect_short}}) can be found in a special {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} Experimental Services Catalog.
