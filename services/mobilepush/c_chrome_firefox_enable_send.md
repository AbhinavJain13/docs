After you have developed your applications, you can send a push notification. 

1. Select **Send Notifications**, and compose a message by choosing **Web Notifications** as the **Send To** option. 
2. Type the message that needs to be delivered in the **Message** field.
3. You can choose to provide optional settings:
  - **Notification Title**: This is the text that would be displayed as message alert heading.
  - **Notification Icon URL**: If your message needs to be delivered with an app notification icon, provide the link to your icon in the field.
  - **Additional payload**: Specifies the custom payload values for your notifications.

The following image shows the web notifications option in the dashboard.
