To set up {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} service, obtain your credentials from your push notification provider: Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) or Apple Push Notification service (APNs). Then set up {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} on the **Push notification** Dashboard or by using the ReST APIs.
