# About toolchains

A *toolchain* is a set of tool integrations that support development, deployment, and operations tasks. The collective power of a toolchain is greater than the sum of its individual tool integrations.    
{:shortdesc}

Toolchains are available in the Public and Dedicated environments on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}. You can create a toolchain in two ways: use a template to create a toolchain or create a toolchain from an app. As a starting point, you can use a toolchain template. Depending on the template that you use, you can create a toolchain that has a specific set of tool integrations or an empty toolchain that you can add tool integrations to.

On {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public, depending on the template or toolchain that you use, the toolchain might include a GitHub repository (repo) that is populated with app starter code and a preconfigured delivery pipeline. When you push changes to the toolchain's GitHub repo, the delivery pipeline automatically builds and deploys the app to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. 

On {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated, depending on the toolchain that you use, the toolchain might include a GitHub Enterprise repo that is populated with app starter code and a preconfigured delivery pipeline. When you push changes to the toolchain's GitHub Enterprise repo, the delivery pipeline automatically builds and deploys the apps to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.
