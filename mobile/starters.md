# Starters
{: #starters}

With the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} Mobile dashboard, you can create your project by using a UI Starter or a Code Starter.


## UI Starter
{: #UI_Starter}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} mobile developers can use UI Starters to create apps using the UI Builder, which enables an application to be designed using a visual editor. <!--The UI Builder assists you when you have an idea to prototype quickly.--> The UI Builder is useful for sketching an idea or when you need to quickly prototype a mobile experience. The UI Builder requires little programming knowledge or mobile development for you to be productive quickly.  <!-- The UI Starters give you patterns of applications that enable you to modify and adjust to your use case needs. If you want to start from scratch and build an idea up from nothing use the Empty starter. Each UI starter is configured to be enabled with Push and Analytics capabilities if you decide to configure this for you Mobile Project.*App views can be bound to data with little programming knowledge, which enables apps to be started and native source code to be generated quickly.* -->

The UI Starters offer patterns of applications that enable you to modify and adjust to your use case needs. Use the Blank starter when you want to build an idea from nothing. Each UI Starter is configured to be enabled with Push and Analytics capabilities, if you decide to configure them for your mobile project.

If you are starting with a UI Starter, continue with [Using a UI Starter to create a project](projects_ui.html).

<!-- If you choose to create your project with a UI Starter, you have the option to design your app from within the UI Builder.-->


## Code Starter
{: #Code_Starter}

Experienced mobile developers, who have a good understanding of Android and iOS development tools, can use Code Starters to integrate common mobile services and key Bluemix services like {{site.data.keyword.ibmwatson}}, {{site.data.keyword.weather_short}}, and {{site.data.keyword.cloudant}}, with a production-ready starting point. These Code Starters massively reduce the time it takes to get your mobile app running with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.

Code Starters are optimized to be production ready starter code that focuses on demonstrating a key {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} integration with a high-value service. Each starter focuses on one service and shows the integration of the service SDKs into the code. In some cases, Code Starters offer a simple user experience to highlight the integration of the service data or interactions with the user. Each Code Starter is configured to be enabled with Push, Authentication, and possibly other capabilities, if you decide to configure them for your mobile project.

If you choose to create your project with a Code Starter, you do not have the option to design your app from within the UI Builder.

If you are starting with a Code Starter, continue with [Using a Code Starter to create a project](projects_code.html).
