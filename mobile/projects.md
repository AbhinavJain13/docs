The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} Mobile dashboard combines the app user interface, data, and services in a complete *project*. By creating a project, all of the required parts of your app and the added capabilities are maintained on the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} server.  You can download your app code after completing your project, and the required IDs to enable the capabilities and data are already added to the required locations in the code.

When creating your project, you can add services to the project.  Services are separate capabilities that extend your app by adding a function.  Because they are added individually, you can add only the services that you need, like push services or other services.  To add services, follow the instructions to set up the service, and then bind it to your project when you create the project.
