The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} Mobile dashboard combines the app user interface, data, and services in a complete *project*. By creating a project, all of the required parts of your app and the added capabilities are maintained on the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} server.  You can download your app code after completing your project, and the required IDs to enable the capabilities and data are already added to the required locations in the code.

When creating your project, you can add services to the project.  Services are separate capabilities that extend your app by adding a function.  Because they are added individually, you can add only the services that you need, like push services, authentication, or other services.  When you add a service to your project on the Project Overview page and follow the instructions to configure it, it is automatically associated with your app.
