The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} Mobile dashboard combines the app user interface, data, and services in a complete *project*. By creating a project, all of the required parts of your app and the added capabilities are maintained on the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} server. You can download your app code after completing your project, and the required IDs for  enabling the capabilities and data are already added to the required locations in the code. You can view all of your projects by selecting *Projects* in the Mobile navigation.  

You can view additional information about a single project by selecting it on the Projects page. This displays the Project Overview page, which includes the services that are configured and available for the project. Services are separate capabilities that extend your app by adding a function. Because they are added individually, you can add the services that you need, like push services, authentication, or other services. When you add a service to your project on the Project Overview page and follow the instructions to configure it, it is automatically associated with your app. For more information about the Project Overview page, see [Project Overview page](project_overview_page.html).

Immediately after creating your project, you must select a Starter for your project. To learn more about Starters, see [Starters](starters.html).
