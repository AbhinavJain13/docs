# Project Overview
{: #project_overview}

You can view and work with a single {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} Mobile dashboard project in the current workspace by opening the Project Overview page by selecting the project on the Projects page. 
{: shortdesc}

The Project Overview page displays a tile for each service that is configured or available for configuring with the selected project. The tile displays the type of the service and an action menu button with three vertically aligned dots. Examples of services that might be available or configured include {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} or Analytics. The compatible services are dependent on the type of project, so not all services will be available to associate with all projects. 

 When a type of service is not yet associated with the project, a **Create** button is displayed on the tile.  When the service is not yet associated with the project, the actions button options are to **Create** an instance of the service or **Add Existing** service. Adding an existing instance provides a list of the service instances of that type that are not associated with other projects. Services can only be associated with one project at a time.

If the service is already associated with this project, the name of the service instance that is associated with it is displayed on the tile after the type of service. This makes it easy to find which service instance is related to this project on your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} dashboard. The actions that are available on the action button **View** and **Remove**. Removing a service instance only removes the association to this project and does not delete the instance of the service from your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} dashboard.

Select **Get Code** on the Build tile to download the code for your project.
