# Using a Code Starter to create a project
{: #projects_code}

You can use a [Code Starter](starters.html#Code_Starter) in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} Mobile dashboard to create a project in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} environment. This procedure does not apply to projects that use the UI Starters. See [Creating a project with a UI Starter](projects_ui.html) for instructions for UI Starters.

Complete the following steps to create a project with a Code Starter:

1. Create a new Mobile dashboard project in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.

 You start with the *Getting Started* tab after you select the Mobile catalog. There are descriptions of selected starters that you can use and different ways to create a project that depend on how much help you need. If you want to just get started, select **Create Project**.

 If you already have projects, you can also start with the *Projects* tab selected. From the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Mobile dashboard **Projects** view, you can select a project to work with, use the *Actions* for a project to delete it or download the code for it, or create a new project.

	1. On the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Console, select **Mobile** after you expand the menu with the three lines next to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} logo. 
	
	2. Select **Create Project**. 

	  You can alternatively select the **Projects** tab to view the projects that are already in your mobile environment and create a new project by clicking **Create Project**.

	3. Click **Code Starters**.  

	4. Select the starter that best matches the type of app that you want to create, and select **Create Project**. There are **UI Starters** and **Code Starters**. See [Starters](starters.html) for more information about starters and how to use them. 
	
	5. Enter a name for your project and select **Create**.
	
2. Make your selections on the **Project Overview** screen.  The **Project Overview** screen displays information about your project and the optional services that you can add to your project, like Push Notifications and Authentication.  

	1. Optional: Select **Add** to add one of the listed services to your project. Edit the **Service name** for your service and click **Create**. When you add services to your project, you link to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} page for that service. Configure the service by providing the information that is required for for the service.
	
	2. Optional: Repeat step *a* for any additional capabilities that you want to add to your project. 

3.  Download your project and complete the setup.

    1. Click **Download Code** and select your preferred language.
   
    2. Extract the archive and view the `README.md` file in a Markdown viewer to complete the setup.
