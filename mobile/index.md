# {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Mobile dashboard
{: #mobile}

The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} Mobile dashboard offers a single place to manage the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} capabilities that you need to create and manage your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Mobile application. You can manage mobile apps through the concept of [Projects](projects.html). The Mobile dashboard brings the most common services that are required for a mobile developer into a single, connected experience that has been optimized for the mobile developer.

The Mobile dashboard enables a mobile developer to create a project from a variety of Starters, create and connect key {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} optimized services to your project, and quickly download working code with SDKs. The SDKs are fully integrated with capability credentials that enable you to have it running on your device in minutes. When your application is running and you have set up and configured Push, Analytics and/or Mobile Authentication capabilities, you can return to your project to monitor and manage engagement with your application users.

While the Mobile dashboard provides an integrated development experience, some developers might still want to have finer-grained control and wire services together manually. If this is your preferred approach, you might want to consider using the [{{site.data.keyword.mobilefirstbp}} Starter boilerplate](try_mobile.html).


<!--With {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} Mobile services, you can incorporate pre-built, managed, and scalable cloud services into your mobile applications. You can focus on building your mobile apps, instead of the complexities of managing the back-end infrastructure.

The Mobile dashboard provides an integrated experience on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} where you can create mobile projects easily from within the dashboard.
-->


To get started with the Mobile dashboard, click the **Mobile** category from your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Console.


## Getting Started
{: getting-started-mobiledashboard}

Create a project on the **Getting Started** page by clicking **Create Project**. You will be presented with [Starter](starters.html) options that enable you to quickly start creating your app.

You can view and manage all of your projects in one place by selecting the Projects page. The project holds the information for all of the capabilities that are (and can be) integrated with your mobile app. If it is available, you can easily integrate and manage Push, Analytics, and Authentication mobile services in the project, with more capabilities to follow in the near future.

The [Services](services.html) view shows an operational view of your existing mobile service instances. The Mobile dashboard supports a mobile developer and a mobile app management user.
