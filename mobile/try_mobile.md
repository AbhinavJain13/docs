# Creating mobile apps from the {{site.data.keyword.mobilefirstbp}} Starter boilerplate
{: #try_mobile}

You can use each of the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} Mobile services independently. You can also use them together, with the {{site.data.keyword.mobilefirstbp}} Starter boilerplate, to get the most benefit.

To get started, use the {{site.data.keyword.mobilefirstbp}} Starter to create your app. The boilerplate enables you to complete the following actions:

* Create a Node.js runtime with a template application. You can use this application to provide server-side functions, such as RESTful APIs and static files. <!-- You can read more about operating this application in the Developing Mobile Backend section.-->
* Provision an instance of each of the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Mobile services and bind the service to the Node.js application.
